## 🚀 How to Run

Most of the projects are written in Python 3.  
To run a script (Linux or Windows):


### 🧪 Using a virtual environment

**Linux/macOS**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Windows (CMD)**
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 🔧 Run a Python file
```bash
python3 your_script.py    # Linux/macOS
python your_script.py     # Windows
```
